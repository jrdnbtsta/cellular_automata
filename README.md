https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Uv_Qh4ReUK68nwfWuNZuOuecgs0WgLua/view

All of the helper functions that I created to help answer this question can be found in `src/cellularAutomata.js`

## Tests
Tests can be found in `tests/test.spec.js`
To run these tests, you can use the following command:
```
npm run test
```

## Run The Code
The code to answer this problem can be found in `src/answerFinalProblem.js`

**Heads Up!**
I'm currently running into `import` issues when running this script via `node`.
Once I fix these `import` issues, you can run the following command to see the answer:
```
node src/answerFinalProblem.js
```

As a workaround in the meantime, running the tests with print the Final Answer in your terminal.
